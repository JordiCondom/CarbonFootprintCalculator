# Project description
Carbon Footprint Calculator: In this project, your task will involve developing a platform that **calculates individual carbon footprints** based on **user input** regarding lifestyle habits, transportation choices, dietary preferences, waste production and consumption patterns. The system should allow users to **track** and **compare** their annual emissions against **national averages** and **global targets**. Additionally, it could include features such as **personalised suggestions** on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and displaying potential offsets through purchases of renewable energy certificates or planted trees.
